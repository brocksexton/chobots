✨ Chobots Source Code ✨


Chobots was an online Flash browser massive multiplayer online game (MMO) set in a virtual world where players could create cartoon alien avatars called "chobots" who resided in floating cities in outer space. Chobots was created, developed, and published by the Ukrainian company Vayersoft LLC, and ran from 2008 until 2011 when the game was shut down. The target audience of Chobots was primarily children and teenagers, though it was marketed as a "family game." Chobots was often compared to other similar contemporary games, including the popular Club Penguin.
