  <title>Polar Star</title>
  <text>A long time ago the Polar Star was of great importance for mankind. Over millennia it served as a guide for travellers as it doesn't change its location in the sky and always points to the North. The Polar Star is very bright and 50 times larger than the Sun.</text>
