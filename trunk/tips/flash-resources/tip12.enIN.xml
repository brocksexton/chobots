  <title>The highest trees</title>
  <text>The highest trees are up to 100 meters high. That is 60 times more than an adult man's height. These trees are called giant sequoias. Their stem thickness is nearly 10 meters. In the past people laid roads and made tunnels through them. Also, they are the most long-lived on Earth. The age of some pieces is a few thousand years. Imagine they had grown out of a seed long before Christ. And they are still growing</text>
