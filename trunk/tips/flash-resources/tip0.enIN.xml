  <title>Pangea</title>
  <text>Many moons ago there was just one continent on the Earth - Pangea, which from Greek means "entire Earth". It was surrounded by the World Ocean from all sides. Pangea broke up into two continents and the resulting crescent was filled with the Tethys Sea. Later those two supercontinents split up and formed the six continents we have today.</text>
