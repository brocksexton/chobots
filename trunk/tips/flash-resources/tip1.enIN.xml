  <title>The Moon</title>
  <text>The Moon is the Earth's only natural satellite. The Moon is also covered with seas (without water, though) and continents. Its surface has many craters. These were formed by meteor crashes a long time ago. The Moon looks different every night. As the Moon orbits the Earth, the sun's light reflects off the Moon. This continuous movement of the Moon around our planet has influenced all the processes taking place on it. The Moon is the only object in space that man has ever visited.</text>
