  <firstItem>Hey there!

My dear fellow, my name's Santa - same as one man's from the North Pole which is on that Blue planet. Take this hat not to catch a cold at this snowed up location.</firstItem>
  <questTask>Hey! Can you help me? I lost my graduation cap and graduation is in 15 minutes! I don't know what to do because I still need to practice my speech. Can you help me find my cap?</questTask>
  <noItem>Come on! The cap won't find itself and I need it now! Go go go! My graduation starts in 15 minutes.</noItem>
