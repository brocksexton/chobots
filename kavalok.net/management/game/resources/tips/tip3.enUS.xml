  <title>Venus Flytrap</title>
  <text>Recently one of our scientists was attacked by a plant - the Venus Flytrap. It is a carnivorous plant that is natively found only in South and North Carolina in the United States. It catches and digests insects and spiders. Its trapping structure is formed by its leaves and is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves comes into contact with one or more of the hairs, the trap closes. The plant resumes hunting only after it has digested its previous prey.</text>
