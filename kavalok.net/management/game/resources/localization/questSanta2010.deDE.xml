  <firstItem>Ho, ho, ho!

My dear fellow, my name's Santa - same as one man's from the North Pole which is on that Blue planet. Take this hat not to catch a cold at this snowed up location.</firstItem>
  <questTask>Santa Cho brings Christmas presents to people every year. I think we should have such great tradition. So I packed my bags with presents, flew around the city trying to find a Party. When I found the place I could land on, one of my bags got torn. And three of my bells fell down to different locations.  I would really appreciate it if you could find and bring them back to me. When the mission is accomplished, you'll receive your Christmas Present. Good luck. See you!</questTask>
  <noItem>Can you please help me find my missing bells?</noItem>
  <nextItem>Thanks so much for finding a bell! Do you think you can find all?</nextItem>
  <questComplete>Good job, you found all my bells!! Now I can get back to delivering presents to all Chobots! Here, take these gifts.</questComplete>
  <idleMessage>Thank you for your help. Happy Holidays!</idleMessage>
