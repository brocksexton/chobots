  <title>The Sun</title>
  <text>The brightest thing in the sky is the sun. It is actually a very small star. In fact most stars are much bigger then it. It is made up of hot gasses and ranges from 5800 to 10 million degrees, depending on which part of the sun. The sun is about 4Â½ million years old and will continue to be in existence for 5 million more years</text>
