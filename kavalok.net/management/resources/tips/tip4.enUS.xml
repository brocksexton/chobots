  <title>Flying fish</title>
  <text>In all of the major oceans we can find flying fish. Their most striking feature is their pectoral fins, which are unusually large. They enable the fish to take short gliding flights through air, above the surface of the water, in order to escape from predators. The glides are usually up to 30-50 metres in length, but some have been observed soaring for hundreds of metres (up to 400 m).</text>
