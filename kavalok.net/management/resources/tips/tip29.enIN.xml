  <title>Electricity</title>
  <text>Bejamin Franklin was testing so he use a kite and a key and he found out about electric cause the lighting hit the kite and it got through to the key and touch Benjamin Franklin so he got light bulbs. Now we use electric for many other things like game systems, computer, phone, light bulb, and lots more.
